	<h1>Descending Thirds Melody</h1>
	<div class="description">
		<p>
		The &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for Descending Thirds Melody are based on the flow 
		of <i>functional harmony</i> and a few melodic intervals.
		</p>
		<p>
		Functional harmony flows from &ldquo;subdominant&rdquo; to &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; to &ldquo;tonic&rdquo;. 
		In Roman numeral symbols that is <span class="music_symbols">I &gt; IV &gt; V</span>. Those chords, in that order, 
		in melodic <i>descending thirds</i> gives the 
		scale degrees <span class="music_symbols">^1 ^6 ^4 ^2 ^7 ^5 ^3 ^1</span>. If those scale degrees are grouped 
		with their corresponding chords, 
		we get <span class="music_symbols">^1 ^6 ^4</span> (IV) <span class="music_symbols">^4 ^2 ^7 ^5</span> 
		(V7) <span class="music_symbols">^5 ^3 ^1</span> (I). This is a useful melodic pattern, because it ensures 
		good harmonic flow. No matter where you start in the scale, if you move in descending melodic third, it always 
		follows good functional harmonic flow. It is found frequently in classical music.
		</p>
	</div>

		<p>
		However, the pattern needs a few additional rules to become a practical guide for making melodies.
		</p>
		<p>
		The line needs to ascend sometimes.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The descending third can be <i>inverted</i> for an <i>ascending sixth</i></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The functional progression <span class="music_symbols">I &gt; IV &gt; V</span> can be rotated 
		to <span class="music_symbols">V &gt; I &gt; IV</span> to reveal 
		it is <i>roots by descending fifths</i>. 
		The root progression in terms of ascent inverts to an <i>ascending fourth</i>. 
		The <i>voice leading</i> of that harmonic pattern involves two chord tones move by one <i>ascending step</i>. 
		Altogether this allows two additional ascending moves...
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An <i>ascending step</i></li>
			<li>An <i>ascending fourth</i></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The interval of a <i>tritone</i> is typically avoided, or at least requires careful handing. For the sake of 
		simplicity we will avoid it. So, moves <span class="music_symbols">B &gt; F</span> or 
		<span class="music_symbols">F &gt; B</span> are forbidden.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <i>tritone</i> is forbidden</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Finally, the melody starts on either ^1 or ^5, continues for several moves, and then forms a cadence.</i> 
		The melody is presented without rhythm nor measures. It is a sort of melodic &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; 
		which could be developed with rhythm and meter, and perhaps embellished, to make an actual melody.
